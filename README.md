# Full Stack Swift: Using Swift on the Backend

This document is my proposal for a talk (either 40 minutes or 3 hours) at O'rielly Fluent Conf 2017 in San Jose.

__Title__: Full Stack Swift: Using Swift on the Backend

__Description__: Use IBM Kitura to create a back end for your mobile application.   Learn how to make a RESTful backend API using Swift so that you no longer have to switch between languages.  The talk will focus on best practices and how to get started with server side swift. Now you can write swift everywhere!

__Topics__: Fullstack Development

__Secondary Topics__: Backend Tools, Mobile, RESTful web

__Session Type__: Either 40 minutes or 3 hour tutorial

__Abstract__:

_Full Stack Swift: Using Swift on the Backend_ will get you up and running as a server side swift developer in no time. We will dive deeply into server side development and come away with a working API that is written in Swift using the IBM Kitura framework.

The talk will include:

* Background on Swift as a server side language:
	* Why choose Swift on the server side?
	* Why use IBM Kitura?
* An overview of the HTTP request/response cycle
* Getting your environment setup for Kitura development
* Request routing in Kitura
* Connecting your server to a database for persistence
* How to build and test a swift API for your mobile app
* Authentication with JWTs


__Presentation Audience__: Software engineers wanting to learn back end development with Swift

__Audience Level__: Beginner (new to server side Swift development, not new to programming or Swift)

__Audience Takeaways__: 

* Why Swift on the backend is a good idea (lower cognitive load, code sharing, future of iOS app development).
* How the http request and response works at a detailed level.
* Applying HTTP to IBM Kitura to create a simple web server.
* Creating a RESTful api using Kitura.
* JWT Token authentication with Kitura.

_Note_: In a 40 minute session, I may not include much on JWT's in swift.

__Prerequisite Knowledge__: The attendee should be able to program in swift at an intermediate level.  Also, some knowledge of iOS application development is required (although the focus will be on the backend).

__Session Type__: How-to

__Hardware and/or installation requirements__: Needs: a mac laptop, a Github account, the latest version of xcode installed

__Video__:
